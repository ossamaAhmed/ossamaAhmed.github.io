      <description>&lt;p&gt;What would a self-driving car do if the car just in front it has malfunctioning break lights? What would it do if a kid suddenly lets go of his motherâ€™s grasp and jumps into the road? What would it do if the sensors it uses for perception break down unexpectedly? All of these situations and more may be captured if the planning algorithms are planning for such uncertainties, which include the behavior of other agents in the environment as well as our perception of the environment itself.&lt;/p&gt;
